# OpenCA Tools

Tools to deal with SCEP and PKCS7 messages.

# Source

This software was developed by the OpenCA Project, but seems not to be 
maintained. We had some enhancements but did not feel brave enough to
fork the project so we made a new version under the old name with some
patches. We plan to integrate the relevant parts into the OpenXPKI 
sources, so this "fork" will disappear in the near future.

The original project and the original source code is available
at the projects website
